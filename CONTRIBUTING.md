## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites ✅

- Python 3.8 or higher 🐍
- Git 📂
- Knowledge of machine learning concepts and frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow) 🧠
- Familiarity with AI conversational models 💬

### Setup 🛠️

1. Fork the repository on GitHub 🍴
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Close_OpenFirma_AI.git
   cd Close_OpenFirma_AI
   ```
3. Add the original repository as an upstream remote:
   ```
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Stillaeidle/Close_OpenFirma_AI.git
   ```
4. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

## Development Workflow 💻

1. Create a new branch from `main` for your work:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   
2. Make your changes, following our coding standards and testing guidelines ✨

3. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages:
   ```
   git commit -m "Add feature: detailed description of changes"
   ```

4. Keep your branch updated with the main repository:
   ```
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

5. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Pull Request Process 🔄

1. Submit a pull request (PR) from your forked repository to our `main` branch 📤
2. Ensure your PR has a clear title and description that explains:
   - What changes you've made
   - Why you've made them
   - Any issues your PR addresses (use "Fixes #123" to link issues)
3. Verify all CI checks pass ✅
4. Wait for a maintainer to review your PR 👀
5. Address any feedback or requested changes 🔁
6. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your contribution 🎉
